# Projects
#1 Hotel Management System
The project is an effort to provide a one-step solution to the customer with a system that can provide them with information regarding availability of rooms in multiple hotels at the same place. The system provides a way to make room bookings for the customers. The availability of the hotel rooms can only be updated by an authorized hotel personnel, and hence it becomes easy for the Customer to select their room from the available rooms. We have implemented Agile Methodology while designing the system. The system is implemented with an Iterative Approach where each iteration of the project helps to accommodate any new features or requirements that are analyzed in the later stages of the SDLC. The overall design of the system was improved by implementing Gang of Four(GoF) patterns like Adapter, Strategy, Controller, Abstract Factory and Singleton. These patterns were applied so that the system has high cohesion modules, low coupling and should be easy to maintain and understand. 

#2 Intruder Detection Using Face Identification
This system includes a camera, which captures live images and detects any intrusion in the room in which it is installed. This camera is connected to a system, which already stores the facial features of the Admin and its family members or office employees. The face of the intruder is extracted from the captured images and video. If this face matches the existing faces in the database then no action takes place; however, if the face does not match, an alarm rings and an SMS is sent to the Admin indicating intrusion. 
The dataset.zip file has the stored dataset which was used to train the system. 

#3 Emergency SOS
This is an android based application that is capable of locating the mobile user on Maps and send their exact location to listed emergency contacts via an SMS.
The entire project was build using Android Studio.
The App implements Google Maps API for retrieving location information of the user.
